    "## What is the invariant mass?\n",
    "Particles have a mass that describes their inertia. It is the same mass $m$ that is used in Newton's second law $F=ma$ and Einstein's equation $E=mc^2$ (where E means the energy of the particle at rest). It is impossible to measure e.g. Higgs boson, whose mean lifetime is in the order of $10^{-22}$ seconds [4]. When a particle such as the Higgs boson decays, new particles are formed. The new particles may move at very high speeds and may even not have a mass (e.g. photons). However, a device such as CMS can measure the momentum and energy of these particles, from which we can calculate the _invariant mass_. It is a property that is \"invariant\" to the environment it's measured in. If it is calculated to two particles that come from another particle, we achieve a value that is close to the mass of the original particle. For example, the Higgs boson can decay into four electrons, whose momentum and energy we can measure with a detector. From these we can calculate the invariant mass, which would correspond to the mass of the Higgs boson, since the electrons come from Higgs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant mass is conserved when a particle decays into other particles, which makes it an unbeatable tool for particle physics. A detector such as the CMS detects mostly stable particles. In order to determine which decay processes produce these stable particles, researchers must analyze large amounts of data. We can calculate the invariant mass to multiple different events and make a histogram out of our calculated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have a histogram of the invariant mass of collisions where a detector has registered two muons. The spikes in the histogram correspond to the different particles the muons decay from.\n",
